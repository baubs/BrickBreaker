This program is a simple game interface used to practice animation in webGL.
The user uses the buttons to control the paddle's movement. Each button press
moves the paddle a fixed distance to the right or left. The ball speed up and 
down buttons do just what they say. The ball's  min speed is .005 in both x and 
y components. There is no upper bound on speed. When the ball hits the paddle the
bounces are redisplayed in the bottom of the window. If the ball reaches the bottom
of the canvas the game is over and an alert is displayed. After the alert is closed,
the buttons are disabled and nothing happens until the user reloads the page.
